At the end of the battle both the Patriarch and Zacharia lay dead.  The Patriarch had cut the left arm from Zacharia's body just as the Necromancer's last spell stopped the Patriarch's heart.  The power of the sword Solkrist instantly slew the Necromancer.  Solkrist disappeared forever in the mayhem after the fight, as did the arm of Zacharia.
