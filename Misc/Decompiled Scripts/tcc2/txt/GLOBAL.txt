Well, I agree.  Your recent accomplishments have become well known throughout the Realm, and you have conducted yourselves in an honorable way.

An Exorcist is one who serves the people by purging the Realm of evil.  The exorcist ‘exorcises’ the evil doers, often by force.   There is a heretical sect that worships the foul god ‘Baal’.  They dwell in the Disordered Sanctum in Norseland.  To qualify as Exorcists, you must purge their temple of all foul worshippers and return to me with the cloak of their High Priestess.  When you have accomplished this task, I will promote you.

2.  Never let a crisis go by without taking advantage of its opportunities.  People are always willing to make ‘bad’ deals and give up lands just to get out from under a crisis.
3.  Leverage.  Yes, leverage.  Take your depositors gold and loan it out at 40-to-one.  Give your depositors a pittance of interest and charge the borrowers a massive usury fee.

Therefore, I give you this Scroll of Fly to assist you in reaching those heights. Return to me as soon as you have found the Last Rose of Winter. I would be eternally grateful and delighted to welcome all of you into the great family of Sylvans … and please be sure to dress warmly my dears." ]]

Georgeton was furious when he came home - with that horrible axe, he killed Wilkit. One chop - and his head fell to the floor. Blood splattered everywhere.

Chaos and His Lords dwell in the Fortress of Anarchy.  Until recently, there was no way to reach it. However, Tamara has discovered a way to access this fortress through the Drow Hive.

The Lesser Drow Goddess Kiaransalee has created an Ether Portal that disrupts the fabric of existence and can transport you to the Fortress of Anarchy.  To reach this device you must violate the Drow Hive in Glacier’s End, traverse a series of dark, dank tunnels, and find the Ether Jewel.  Tamara will meet you at the Ether Portal to provide you with additional information.

Good luck!" ]]

I haven’t been able to discover the location of the fourth key, so you’ll have to work that out yourselves.

The Captains of the Chaos Lord wield powerful Ether Weapons that may allow you to triumph over the God Chaos and his spawn.
