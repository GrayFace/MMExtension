Their life cycle forces them to breed until the world cannot support their numbers, then they send ships off to other worlds to renew the cycle.  Their attacks against the empire of the Ancients disrupted the network of shipping and communications that held us all together, causing the Silence that marks the first year of our modern calendar.  Without support from the homeworlds, our fledgling technology failed, bringing us to this sorry state.  I would help rebuild our technology, but I seem to have become a religious figure in the minds of many people, and very few visit me or understand what I have to offer.

This gives me the right to promote archers to the title of battle mage and warrior mage as I see fit.  I’ll grant the title of battle mage to all the archers amongst you if you do me a little favor. I need the key to the old Dragon Towers set up near every major settlement in Enroth to shoot down flying creatures.  I think that they can be set to shoot down only monsters, instead of shooting anything flying through the air. Since this is something of a pet project, I will reward honorary battle mage status to the rest of you.  The key is in my old keep near the southern entrance to my lands.  I had to leave it there when the ogres and their companions took it from me a few years ago.  Return with that key and be rewarded.  And I won’t be crying in my beer if you kill a lot of those monsters while you’re at it.  They took my keep!"

I ended up being one of the targets, and Gerrard took control of the Order.  Now, the Silver Helms are as evil as the people they hunt.  I’m certain the Temple of Baa is responsible for the corruption of our Order.
