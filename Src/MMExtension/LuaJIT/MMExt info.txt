LuaJIT 2.0.5 has a bug that results in random crashes on startup from time to time.
OpenResty fork of LuaJIT 2.1.* doesn't seem to have this bug, but something's wrong with its header files (probably incompatible with VS2005).
So, I use header files from LuaJIT 2.0.5, but lua51.lib and lua51.dll from OpenResty fork.
I also had to modify OpenResty fork a bit to make it build in VS2005 (without C99 support).
VS versions with C99 support don't support Windows XP by default and there's no info on how to configure that from command line.
